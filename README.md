# Splunk Piper Paralelo also known as Splunk Shake

This app contains all the base code from [splunk/parallel-piper](https://github.com/splunk/parallel-piper) and I dind't made any changes to it. My point here was to change the Citys and the Country displayed on the page showed to the user so that when a user accesses the site, will be shown the 26 cities and 1 federal district of Brazil.

Be sure to follow the rules given in the original github.

Appreciate!!
